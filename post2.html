    <p style = "text-align:justify;font-family: 'Quicksand';">Cookie first wandered into Hall 10 in 2022, a little whirlwind of charm and mischief. From the moment she arrived, it was impossible not to notice her. Humans and dogs alike seemed drawn to her gentle yet playful energy. She quickly made friends everywhere, earning pats, treats, and a special place in everyone’s hearts.

Soon, Cookie became a mother. She gave birth to two tiny pups. Everywhere she went, her little ones followed, tails wagging in perfect unison. But fate can be cruel. A viral infection took the pups from her far too soon, leaving Cookie quiet, subdued, as though carrying a grief that was almost visible. She still came for pats, still nudged her head into caring hands, but the sparkle she once had dimmed.<br><br>

And then some six months later something unexpected happened. One day, Cookie did something no one could quite explain. She had taken, rather stolen pups from another mother, Goldie. These pups, despite having no milk to feed them, clung to her as if she were their own. It was strange, even a little shocking, but it made sense in a way only Cookie could embody. Goldie had been unwell, feverish, keeping her babies close but distant. Cookie stepped in, a surrogate aunt.

Even as the pups nipped and tugged, leaving her bruised and bloodied, Cookie never faltered. She kept them warm and safe.<br><br>Today, one of Goldie’s pups still roams near Mama Mio, we remember Cookie through him.

In 2024, Cookie passed away, likely from distemper. She bore her pain silently, hiding away from people and other dogs. Yet for those who knew her, Cookie’s memory is indelible.  Volunteers and friends remember her not for the sadness she endured, but for the warmth and life she shared so freely.</p>
