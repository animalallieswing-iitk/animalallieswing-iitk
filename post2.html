    <h2>Cookie the puppy stealer</h2>
    <p>Cookie first wandered into Hall 10 in 2022, a little whirlwind of charm and mischief. From the moment she arrived, it was impossible not to notice her. Humans and dogs alike seemed drawn to her gentle yet playful energy. She quickly made friends everywhere, earning pats, treats, and a special place in everyone’s hearts.

Soon, Cookie became a mother herself. She gave birth to two tiny pups, and for a brief, shining moment, the world seemed complete for her. Everywhere she went, her little ones followed, tails wagging in perfect unison. But fate can be cruel. A viral infection took the pups from her far too soon, leaving Cookie quiet, subdued, and carrying a grief that was almost visible. She still came for pats, still nudged her head into caring hands, but the sparkle she once had dimmed.

And then something unexpected happened. One day, Cookie did something no one could quite explain. She had taken two pups from another mother, Goldie. The pups, despite having no milk to feed them, clung to her as if she were their own. It was strange, even a little shocking, but it made sense in a way only Cookie could embody. Goldie had been unwell, feverish, keeping her babies close but distant. Cookie stepped in, a surrogate aunt, a guardian of little lives.

Even as the pups nipped and tugged, leaving her scratched and bruised, Cookie never faltered. She kept them warm, safe, and loved. She gave all she had, though her own heart had known sorrow. One of Goldie’s pups still roams near Mama Mio, a living reminder of Cookie’s fierce, selfless love.

In 2024, Cookie passed away, likely from distemper. She bore her pain silently, as she had done all her life, choosing to spare others her suffering and fade quietly. Yet for those who knew her, Cookie’s memory is indelible. She was not just a dog. She was a heart that chose love over sorrow, kindness over despair, every single day. Even now, volunteers and friends remember her not for the sadness she endured, but for the warmth and life she shared so freely.</p>
