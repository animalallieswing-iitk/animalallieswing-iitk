    <p style = "text-align:justify;font-family: 'Quicksand';">I was returning from the mess in Hall 4 with my friend when we spotted a tiny squirrel near a tree. It was crying, clearly distressed, and had a wound on its hind leg. We gently picked it up and took it to our room. There, we set up a small box with a soft cloth inside, and fed it milk and bread, sweetly given to us by the canteen bhaiya.

At first, the little squirrel was terrified, but slowly it began to trust us. Soon it would climb onto our shoulders and heads, and sometimes even fall asleep in our hands. We named him Kittu.<br><br>

Kittu had the time of his life with us, moving between Hall 4 and Hall 13, enjoying unlimited fruits, milk, and nuts. More than anything, he became the centre of our attention. We treated him like our own baby, cleaned his wound, and took care of him every single day. 

After a week, his injury healed completely.
And then came the bittersweet moment,it was time to say goodbye. We released Kittu near the same tree in Hall 4 where we found him, hoping he’d return to the life he is belonged to. I still hope he remembers us and stays somewhere close to that tree, living happily and freely. <br><br><span style = "font: italic;">- Nandini</span></p>
